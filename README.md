## Features

- **Multiple libraries** — add as many folders as you want, each with independent content and playback state. Switch between them from the sidebar dropdown or manage them all from a single sheet.
- **Library management** — point Shelf at any folder and it scans for m4b, m4a, and mp3 files, extracting metadata and cover art automatically
- **Multiple view modes** — browse your library as a grid, large grid, or sortable list
- **Playback** — play/pause, skip forward/back 30s, adjustable speed (0.5x-2x), chapter navigation, and media key support
- **Bookmarks** — mark important moments with a name and optional note, jump back to them anytime
- **Smart Collections** — auto-grouped sidebar views: Recently Added, Short Books, Long Books, Not Started, Nearly Finished
- **Progress tracking** — playback position is saved automatically and persists across launches
- **Import/Export** — backup and restore your progress and bookmarks as a JSON file
- **Mini Player** — floating always-on-top player that follows across desktop spaces
- **Sidebar navigation** — browse by author, genre, year, smart collection, or status
